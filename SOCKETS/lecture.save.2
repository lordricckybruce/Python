Networking summary

private ip address are those assigned to devices that are only connected to LAN, but cannot be used for internet connection.
DHCP dynamic host configuration protocol is responsible for assigning ip address dynamically, we dont have constant ip address
NAT network address translation covers ip address to external public address to be able to route the internet and gives feedback by coverting the external public ip address to the private so that packets are recieved
Ports are sub-address, while ip is the address, think this way, ip address is name of a street while port is the building number/apartment number, and 2^16 == 65,536 ports.
Protocols are agreed ways to communicate such as IP, TCP,UDP,FTP,HTTP,SMTP.

IP defines source and destination IP address of a packet as it traverse the inetrnet

NETWORK TOPOLOGY
1. Bus: Every device is connected together in a single line, if ntework is busy it become congested
2. star: makes use of a server, and if one client is broken, does not affect the rest
3. Ring: sends packet around the ring and only client the packet is intended for can grab from the ring. It is inexpensive and simple but if broken all cliwnt cannot recieve.
4. Mesh: many connection between each device on the network

chapter2 subnetting and cidr notation
subnetting lets network adminstrator use 32bits in ipv4
subnet is a network within a network
CIDR classless inter-domain routing notation represents ip address using(/) such as 192.168.1.0/24 (where 24 represents number of bits)
Subnetting allows network adminstrator not to run on same network ID
Subnets are network within a network namely A,B and C and are created using one or more  host bits to extend the network ID


chapter3 __ Network analysis
ping helps to analyze if another system is live on my network or the internet
ping [dn] or [ip] ping paypal.com ping 192.168.1.0
ICMP - internet control message protocol are protocol used by network devices to send error messages and operational information and ping a an ICMP 
icmp is for network diagnostics and error reporting
packets are small units of data
for network analysis ping and netstat
netstat :network statistic shows all networks coming and going out of our system netstat (ip address)
